lapzbot is a multi-purpose utility bot that I wrote for my discord server `osu! India`. Its a nifty little utility bot. Some of its features include :
* Playing music- both local files and online songs
* Fun games- Number guess, Trivia quiz, 8ball
* Awesome chat emotes
* Osu related functions- user stats & user top plays
